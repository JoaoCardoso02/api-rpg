## Creator Opinions

I'm learning C# and .NET and I find a video/material about this topic and I resolve implements it, so here we are. You can find the material below!
I come from NodeJs, so a language like C# is a little bit difference and difficult for me, so this project can help me a lot.
Here, I learn some dotnet CLI commands and how to work with C# in VS Code platform.
